            <h2>Witness the Revival of Īle Lutheran Church</h2>
            <p>The previously long-abandoned and left-for-ruin church of Īle has been on a breath-taking journey of rejuvenation within the past decade. Helmed by famous conductor <strong>Ints Teterovskis</strong>, the restoration efforts have seen the church receiving a new roof, flooring, furnishing, cosmetic renovations and even a brand new altar.</p>
            <p>The newest addition to the church - a fully fuctional chuch organ - has recently been installed and can already be heard in several of the monthly concerts in the church.

            <h2>Īle Bunker of National Partisans</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Īle Bunker of National Partisans</strong> was the largest such bunker in the Baltic States, housing forces resisting the Soviet occuption following World War 2. Today it is a memorial - a harsh reminder of the brutalities of the past - and a hotspot of military heritage tourism.</p>
            <img class="photo" alt="picture of a monument depicting a sword and a shield" src="images/Iles bunkurs 2017.JPG">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Built in 1948. in the deep, darks woods surround the village of Īle by Latvian and Lithuanian national partisans, the bunker housed a guerilla group of almost 30 people. The partisans, lead by Kārlis Krauja, were defeated by the Soviet Secret Police forces in 1949.</p>
            <p>In 2009, sixty years after the final battle at the fortress, the destroyed remains of the bunker were rebuilt - the the bunker can now be visited and entered. Within it, a few few under the grund, a visitor will find narrow sleeping racks, a table, even an oven for heating. </p>

            <h3>Area</h3>
            <p>The bunker and the adjacent memorial can be found halway between the villages of Īle and Zebrene. The nearby area is a mixed forest, popular as a mushroom and berry picking sport among locals. The woods are a beautiful, but challening terrain for hiking - there is a large number of undocumented trails, smaller and larger hills and uncountably many swampy areas. </p>

The building later served as the Īle primary school, until it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1990s. Today, the open-air stage hosts concerts and celebrations on public holidays, traditional celebrations and the annual local "Dziesminieki" festival in August.</p>   </div>
